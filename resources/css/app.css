/* The "Failed to decode downloaded font" error is NOT caused by your CSS anymore.
   It happens if you use @font-face with a CSS url, which you are NOT doing now.
   If you still see the error, clear your browser cache and reload.
   Make sure you only have this in your Blade template (not in CSS):

   <link href="https://fonts.bunny.net/css?family=instrument-sans:400,500,600" rel="stylesheet" />

   Do NOT add @font-face for Instrument Sans in your CSS.
